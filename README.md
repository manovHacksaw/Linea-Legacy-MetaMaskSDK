# **Linea LEGACY – Secure Your Digital & Educational Wealth**  

## **Overview 🚀**  
Losing access to private keys, seed phrases, and digital assets is a nightmare—you lose everything forever. But what if you had a **trustless, automated** solution to securely **pass down your assets, educational funds, and intellectual property** to your loved ones or future scholars?  

**Linea LEGACY** is a **decentralized smart will solution** built on the **secure and scalable Linea Chain**. Our **Smart Will system** leverages blockchain technology to **automate, protect, and securely execute asset distribution** based on predefined conditions, ensuring that your **scholarships, research, and educational wealth are never lost**.

## **Key Features ✨**  

### **📜 Dual Will System**  
- **Normal Wills** – Single-beneficiary inheritance with a **custom inactivity lock** (default 10 years, adjustable for testing).  
- **Milestone Wills** – Multi-phase distributions with **education-based triggers** (e.g., graduation, course completion, research milestone).  

### **🎓 Education & Scholarship Protection**  
- **Secure funding for students** through programmable **trust-based releases**.  
- **Automated scholarship management** – Institutions can allocate **blockchain-verified grants** with **automatic disbursement**.  
- **Learning resource inheritance** – Ensure **valuable educational assets (certificates, research, NFTs)** are safely transferred.  

### **⏰ Custom Time-Based Automation**  
- **Adjustable activity check** (default 10 years, but custom time allowed for testnet).  
- **1-year withdrawal cooldown** for secure claims.  
- **Milestone-specific release schedules** based on academic progress or predefined conditions.  

### **🔒 Security & Trustless Execution**  
- **Immutable Beneficiary Assignments** – Once set, cannot be altered.  
- **Anti-Frontrunning Protection** – Prevents unauthorized claims.  
- **Signature-Based Claim Verification** – Ensures only authorized beneficiaries receive assets.  
- **Fund Locking** – Assets securely held in contract until conditions are met.

## **Developer Integration 🧐**  

### **Installation**  
```bash  
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts ethers  
```  

### **Claiming as a Beneficiary**  
Here’s a function that allows beneficiaries to check their claimable wills:  
```solidity  
function getNormalWillAsBeneficiary(address _beneficiary) external view returns (address[] memory owners, uint256[] memory amounts) {  
    uint256 count = 0;  
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < willOwners.length; i++) {  
        address user = willOwners[i];  
        if (hasNormalWill[user] && normalWills[user].beneficiary == _beneficiary && !normalWills[user].isClaimed) {  
            count++;  
        }  
    }  
    owners = new address[](count);  
    amounts = new uint256[](count);  
    uint256 index = 0;  
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < willOwners.length; i++) {  
        address user = willOwners[i];  
        if (hasNormalWill[user] && normalWills[user].beneficiary == _beneficiary && !normalWills[user].isClaimed) {  
            owners[index] = user;  
            amounts[index] = normalWills[user].amount;  
            index++;  
        }  
    }  
    return (owners, amounts);  
}  
```

## **Security Architecture 🛡️**  

1. **Fund Locking** – Assets held in contract until conditions are met.  
2. **Temporal Validation** –  
   - **Custom inactivity lock** (default 10 years, but customizable for testing).  
   - **Time-based milestone releases** (graduation, course completion, research progress).  
   - **1-year withdrawal cooldown**.  
3. **Identity Verification** –  
   - **Beneficiary ≠ Owner** (ensuring trustless execution).  
   - **Claimant signature validation**.  
4. **Financial Safeguards** –  
   - **Percentage-based releases** (≤100%) to prevent overclaims.  
   - **Anti-overclaim protection**.  
   - **Platform fee deduction on will creation**.
